== Introduction

BB Productive is for those who looking for motivation in their work. This app serves as a great task manager and includes a Pomodoro feature and a Pet companion. It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BB Productive can get you to get tasks done faster. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
